# F1 GIS

A sample JS game to exercise the idea of mashing GIS maps as a base for a top-down racing game.

This is pretty much work in progress to validate the ideas and assert playability.

This project showcases the adoption of the [open race track format](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/open-race-track-format) for designing race tracks.


## Plan

- [x] basic GIS poly drawing
- [ ] support main geojson types
  - [ ] 
- [ ] support RT extensions
  - [ ] width
  - [ ] alignment-from-track
  - [ ] model and model-batch
- [ ] render cars at scale and properly rotated
- [ ] keyboard movement
- [ ] car movement
- [ ] implement checkpoints to validate lap number and clock lap time
- [ ] camera with zoom and rotation?
