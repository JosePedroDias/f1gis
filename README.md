# F1 GIS

A sample JS game to exercise the idea of mashing GIS maps as a base for a top-down racing game.

This is pretty much work in progress to validate the ideas and assert playability.

This project showcases the adoption of the [open race track format](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/open-race-track-format) for designing race tracks.
